To build manually on the command line:

1. Compile

Run:

java -d [another directory] @sources.txt

It is recommended to place the build files in another directory to avoid extra files in the JAR.

2. Copy Resources

Copy the resources (/res, /VERSION.txt, /LICENSE.txt) to the new directory.

3. Package

Navigate to the new directory, then run:

jar cmf [original directory]/manifest.txt Salvato.jar ./*
